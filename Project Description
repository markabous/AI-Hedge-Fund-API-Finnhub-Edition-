AI Equity Research Agent 📈🤖
Project Motivation & Purpose
I developed this project to demonstrate how Generative AI and workflow automation can democratize institutional-grade financial analysis. My goal was to build an autonomous agent capable of synthesizing raw market data into actionable investment theses, effectively simulating the workflow of a Junior Equity Analyst.

This tool solves the problem of "analysis paralysis" by instantly aggregating real-time financials and news sentiment, transforming complex datasets into a clear, readable investment verdict.

Functional Overview
This application functions as an end-to-end "AI Hedge Fund" dashboard. It orchestrates a pipeline that moves from raw data ingestion to high-level reasoning.

The Workflow:

Frontend Interface: A responsive React and Tailwind CSS dashboard accepts a stock ticker (e.g., AAPL, NVDA).

Orchestration (n8n): The request triggers a complex automation workflow in n8n:

Market Data: Fetches real-time price, P/E ratios, PEG, ROE, and Debt/Equity metrics via the Finnhub API.

Sentiment Data: Aggregates the top 5 relevant news headlines from major financial outlets (Bloomberg, WSJ, Reuters) via NewsAPI.

AI Analysis: The aggregated data is fed into Llama 3.3 70B (via Groq). The LLM is prompt-engineered to act as a Senior Analyst, performing:

Fundamental Analysis: Evaluating financial health based on the fetched metrics.

Qualitative Analysis: Assessing risks based on news sentiment.

Valuation Verdict: Determining if the stock is undervalued, overvalued, or fairly valued.

Visualization: The resulting report is rendered back to the user in a clean, Markdown-formatted financial report.

Tech Stack
Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS, DOMPurify

Backend/Orchestration: n8n (Workflow Automation)

AI/LLM: Llama 3.3 70B (via Groq API)

Financial APIs: Finnhub (Market Data), NewsAPI (Sentiment)

Why this works for recruiters:
For Technical Recruiters:

It mentions Groq and Llama 3.3, showing you are up to date with the latest high-performance inference tools.

It shows you understand ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)—extracting from Finnhub, transforming in n8n, and loading into the frontend.

It highlights Error Handling and CORS management (evident in your React code).

For Finance Recruiters:

It explicitly lists the metrics you used (P/E, PEG, ROE, Debt/Equity), proving you understand what drives company valuation.

It mentions "Fundamental" vs. "Qualitative" analysis, showing you know the difference between numbers and news.

It frames the project as an "Equity Research" tool, which is a specific job function they recruit for.
